Model Deployment:

Two Ways - 
    1. Batch (offline mode) - Run Regularly
    2. Streaming (Running Continously) (Online Mode) - 
        a) Web Services
        b) Streaming

Batch:
    Regular Interval model run - (hourly, Daily, weekly, monthly etc)
        Database -> Running model Daily -> Prediction -> Dashboard

        ex. Marketing Related Task (Churn Predction)

Web Service:
    - Up and Running all the time
    - Instant Predction
    - kind of client-server (1*1 Relationship where client is backend)

    User(App) -> Backend -> Model -> Predict -> User
    
    ex. Taxi Ride duration prediction


Streaming:
    - (1*N) or (N*N) Relationship
    - one or more producers and one or more consumers

    - there is no direct connection between producers and consumers
    ex. User(App) -> Backend -> Ride_Started -> Tip_Prediction
                                          -> Duration_Predction  

    ex. User (Uploads Video on the youtube) -> Backend -> EventStream -> consumer1 (Copyright violation) ->
                                                                -> Consumer2 (Adult videos restrcion) > prediction Event Stream - > Decision Service 
                                                                       -> consumer3 (violence) ->
                                                                       -> etc ->

    ex. Recommendation Systme: once video uploded whome to notify, whome to avoid etc.
